Total Time to Type String

The program must accept a string K containing all 26 lower case alphabets representing the
keys in a keyboard as the input. All the keys in the keyboard are arranged in a row. A boy
wants to type the string S$ using the keyboard. The value of S is also passed as the input to the
program. The program must find the total seconds required to type the string S based on the
following conditions.
- Initially, the boy is pointing to the key that he wants to type first (i.e., The first alphabet of
the string S).
- The boy can only move from the current key to its adjacent keys.
- Moving from the current key to its adjacent-keys(possibly two adjacents) take 1 second.
- To press any key it takes 0 seconds.
Finally, the program must print the total number of seconds required to type the string S.as
the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains K.
The second line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the total number of seconds required to
type the string S based on the following conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Output:
41

Explanation:
The 26 keys are arranged as abcdefghijkImnopgqrstuvwxyz.
The given string is notebook.
Initially the boy is pointing to the key ‘n’.
n -> 0 (1 second).
o -> t (5 seconds).
t-> e (15 seconds).
e -> b (3 seconds).
b -> 0 (13 seconds).
0 -> 0 (0 seconds).
o -> k (4 seconds).
The total seconds required to type the word notebook is 41 (1+5+15+3+13+4).
So 41 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
zyxwvutsrqponabcdefghijklm.
bookkeeper

Output:
44

Max Execution Time Limit: 500 millisecs
