Triangle Edges with Same Alphabet

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print a triangle of size
N based on the following conditions.
-The edge between the top corner(inclusive) and the right corner of the triangle must be
formed using the alphabet 'a'
-The edge between the right corner(inclusive) and the left corner of the triangle must be
formed using the alphabet 'b'.
-The edge between the left corner(inclusive) and the top corner of the triangle must be
formed using the alphabet 'c'.
-The empty spaces in the triangle must be filled with asterisks.c
Finally, the program must print the triangle pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output
section.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 50
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first N lines contain the triangle pattern based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
5

Output:
****a
***c*a
**c***a
*c*****a
c b b b b

Explanation:
Here N = 5, so the size of the triangle is 5.
Hence the output is
****a
***c*a
**c***a
*c*****a
c b b b b

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
6

Output:
*****a
****c*a
***c***a
**c*****a
*c*******a
c b b b b

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
