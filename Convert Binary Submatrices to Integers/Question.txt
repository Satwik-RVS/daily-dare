Convert Binary Submatrices to Integers

The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The
matrix contains only Os and 1s. The values of R and C are always divisible by K, For each CK
submatrix, the program must print an integer whose binary representation is formed using the
bits in the submatrix.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= K <=5

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
JEC The next R lines each contains C integer values separated by a space.
The R+2nd line contains K

Output Format:
The first R/K lines, each contains C/K integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

4 4
1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0
2

Output
11 5
14 6

Explanation:
1st submatrix -> 1011 -> 11.
2nd submatrix -> 0101 -> 5.
3rd submatrix -> 1110 -> 14.
4th submatrix -> 0110 -> 6.
Hence the output is
11 5
14 6

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
69
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 

Output:
72 475 103
142 217 311

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
