Shift & Caps Lock in a Text Editor

The program must accept a string S representing the keys that are used to type a message in
a text editor. The keys can be any of the following,
- All 26 lower case alphabets.
- "SHIFT" key.
- CAPSLOCK" key.

Initially, the CAPSLOCK is turned off. The alphabets that occur after "SHIFT +" must be
toggled(upper to lower or lower to upper). The program must find the message from the
given string and print it is as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format:
The first line contains a string value representing the message.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
SHIFT +s k i l l CAPSLOCK r SHIFT +ank a b c

Output:
SkillRankABC

Explanation:
Initially, the CAPSLOCK = OFF.
SHIFT+s -> S
k -> k
l -> L
l -> L
CAPSLOCK = ON.
r -> R
SHIFT +ank -> ank
a -> A
b -> B
c -> C
Hence the output is SkillRankABC.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
CAPSLOCK s k i I I SHIFT +rank CAPSLOCK SHIFT+code

Output:
SKILLrankCode

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
