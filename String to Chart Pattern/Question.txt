String to Chart Pattern

The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The string S
always starts with a consonant. The program must print the string like a line chart as shown in
the Example input/Output section. The line in the chart always increases till the 1st vowel. Then
the line decreases till the 2nd vowel. Then the line increases till the 3" vowel. Then the line
decreases till the 4h vowel, and so on. The empty spaces before each character must be
printed as hyphens.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains s.
Output Format:
The lines contain the string like a line chart as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
skillrack

Output:
--i
-k-l
s---l---k
-----r-c
------a

Explanation:
Here S = "skillrack"
The first occuring vowel is 'i', so the characters till 'i' are printed in increasing order.
The second occuring vowel is "a', so the characters till 'a' are printed in decreasing order.
No more vowels left in the given string, so the remaining characters are printed in increasing
order.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input
pineapple

Output:
-i
p-n-a
---e-p
------p
-------l
--------e

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
NOTEBOOKS

Output:
--------S
-O---O-K
N-T-B-O
---E

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
