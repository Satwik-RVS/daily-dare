function findTheMissingBit

The function/method findTheMissingBit accepts two arguments str and X. The string str
represents the binary representation of the integer X but exactly one bit is missing.
The function/method findTheMissingBit must find the missing bit in the string S and return the
missing bit as an integer value.

Your task is to implement the function findMissing Bit so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Use the main() function, Which is defined below.

int main()
{
    char str[1001];
    scanf("%s",str);
    int X;
    scanf("%d",&X);
    printf("%d",findTheMissingBit(str,X));
    return 0;
}


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
10111
45

Output:
0

Explanation:
The string S = "10111".
The binary representation of 45 is 101101.
The missing bit in the string S is 0, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
111
15

Output:
1

Max Execution Time Limit: 500 millisecs
