Append And Removing

The program must accept N queries as the input. The program must form a string S based on
the given N queries. Initially, the string S is empty. Each query can be any of the following four
types.
1) +CH => Append the character CH to S.
2) CH+ => Prepend the character CH to S.
3) -CH => Remove the last occurrence of CH in S only if CH is present in S.
4) CH- > Remove the first occurrence of CHin'S only if CH is present in S.
The program must print the string S after processing the N queries as the input. If the string S
is empty after processing the N queries, then the program must print 1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <-N <= 1000
input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N queries separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains S or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8
+c o+ c+ -c e+ +d +e e-

Output:
code

Explanation:
Initially, the string S is empty.
+c => S = "c"
o+ => S = "oc"
c+ => S = "coc"
-C => S = "co"
e+ => S = "eco"
+d => S = "ecod"
+e => S = "ecode"
e- => S = "code"

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
9
+c +k -S a+ R+ -R -a -c -k

Output:
-1

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
