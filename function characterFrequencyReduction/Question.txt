function characterFrequencyReduction

The function/method characterFrequencyReduction accepts two arguments str and K
representing a string value and an integer value respectively.
The function/method characterFrequencyReduction must remove the characters after their Kth
occurrence in the given string(from left to right). Then the function must return the revised
string as a new string.

Your task is to implement the function characterFrequencyReduction so that the program runs
successfully

IMPORTANT: Use the main() function, Which is defined below.

int main( )
{
    char str[1001];
    int K;
    scanf("%s\n%d", str, &K);
    char *newStr = characterFrequencyReduction (str, K);
    if (newStr == str || newStr == NULL)
    {
        printf( "New String is not formed\n");
    }
    if (newStr[0] == ' ' || newStr[0] == '\0' )
    {
        printf("String is empty\n");
    }
    printf("%s", newStr);
    return 0;
}

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
aabbabcdccbab

Output:
aabbede

Explanation:
Here the given string is aabbabcdccbab and K=2.

After removing the characters that occur more than 2 times in the given string, the string
becomes aabbcdc.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
TOOLONGTOURtoolongtour

Output:
TOOLNGTURtoolngtur
