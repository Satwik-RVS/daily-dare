Find Smallest Subarrays Length

The program must accept two arrays A and B of equal size N as the input. For every index i in
the array A, the program must print the length of the smallest subarray starting from the index
isuch that the subarray contains at least B[i] integers greater than or equal to A[i]. If there is
no such subarray starting from the index i, the program must print -1.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100,
1 <= Each integer value <= 1045

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space representing the array A.
The third line contains N integers separated by a space representing the array B.

Output Format:
The first line contains N integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
5
9 2 5 2 10
2 3 6 1 1

Output:
5 3 -1 1 1

Explanation:
For i = 0, the smallest subarray is [9, 2, 5, 2, 10] -> Length = 5.
i = 1, the smallest subarray is [2, 5, 2] -> Length = 3.
i = 2, there is no such smallest subarray -> So -1 is printed.
i = 3, the smallest subarray is [2] -> Length = 1.
i = 4, the smallest subarray is [10] -> Length = 1.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
6
39 53 13 11 11 84
2 1 3 3 2 2

Output:
2 1 -1 3 2 -1
