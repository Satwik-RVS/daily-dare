From String Form Character & Integer Matrices

The program must accept a string S and an integer N as the input. The string contains N*N
integers and N*N alphabets without any space. The number of digits in all N'N integers is
equal. The program must form two matrices M1(integer matrix) and M2(character matrix) of
equal size N*N. The matrix M1 must be formed using the integers in S and the matrix M2
must be formed using the alphabets in S. Finally, the program must print the matrices M1
and M2 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
8 <= Length of S <= 4000
2 <= N <= 25

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains N.
Output Format:
The first N lines, each contains N integer values separated by a space.
The next N lines, each contains N characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
1045a20s80df
2

Output:
10 45
20 80
a s
d f

Explanation:
Here N = 2, so the size of M1 and M2 is equal to 2*2.
There are four 2-digit integers in the string.
10 45 20 80
There are four alphabets in the string.
a s d f

The integer matrix M1 is
10 45
20 80

The character matrix M2 is
a s
d f

Example Input/Output 2:
Input
123471859548f3214g7410hiabc50006006de98746542
3

Output:
1234 7185 9548
3214 7410 5000
6006 9874 6542
f g h
i a b
