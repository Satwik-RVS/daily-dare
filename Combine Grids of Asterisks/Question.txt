Combine Grids of Asterisks

The program must accept a grid of size N*N containing asterisks and exactly one hash symbol
as the input. The hash symbol indicates the bottom-right corner of another N*N grid of
asterisks. The program must print the combined grid of asterisks as shown in the Example
Input/Output section. The empty spaces must be printed as hyphens.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains N characters separated by a space.

Output Format:
The lines contain the combined grid of asterisks separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
4

* * * *
* # * *
* * * *

Output:
* * * * - -
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * *
- - * * * *

Explanation:
Here N=4, so the size of grid is 4*4.
The combined 4*4 grids of asterisks is given below.
