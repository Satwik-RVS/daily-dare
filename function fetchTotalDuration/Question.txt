function fetchTotalDuration

The function/method fetchTotalDuration accepts an argument str representing a string value.
The string str contains the duration of a certain number of videos (in 24-hr format
HH:MM:SS) separated by a space.
The function/method fetchTotalDuration must return the total duration of the videos in days,
hours, minutes and seconds.
Your task is to implement the function fetchTotalDuration so that the program runs
successfully.
The following structure is used to represent the Duration and is already defined in the default
code (Do not write this definition again in your code).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Duration
{
    int days;
    int hours;
    int minutes;
    int seconds;
};


IMPORTANT: Use the main() function, which is defined below.

int main()
{
    char str[1001];
    scanf("%[^\n]", str);
    struct Duration *duration = fetchTotalDuration(str);
    if(duration == NULL)
    {
        printf("Duration is not formed\n");
    }
    printf("%d %d %d %d", duration->days, duration->hours, duration->minutes, duration->seconds);
    return 0;
}
