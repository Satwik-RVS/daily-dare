Divide the Matrix into Nine Submatrices

The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C and four integers X, Y, P, Q as the
input. The program must divide the matrix into nine submatrices based on the following
condition.
- The program must divide the matrix horizontally after the X" row and Y* row, Then the
prograrn must divide the matrix vertically after the P“ column and Q™ column.
Finally, the program must print the sum of integers in each submatrix as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000
1 <= X < Y <R
T <= P < Q < C
Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.
The R+2nd line contains X, Y, P and Q separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains nine integer values separated by a space representing the sum of
integers in the nine submatrices.

Explanation:
Here X = 3, Y =5, P=2 and Q=4.
The nine submatrices and their sums are given below.
1st submatrix sum =6+9+7+1+9+9=41.
