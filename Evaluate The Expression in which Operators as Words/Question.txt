Evaluate The Expression in which Operators as Words

The program must accept a string S representing an arithmetic expression. The expression
contains the integer values and the operators in words (plus for +, minus for -, multiply for *
and divide for /). The program must evaluate the expression from left to right and print the
resulting integer value as the output.
Note: The divide operator (/) must return the quotient when the numerator is divided by the
denominator.

Boundary Condition(s):
8 <= Length of S <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the resulting integer.

Example input/Output 1:

Input:
10 plus 20 minus 5 multiply 4 divide 50

Output:
2

Explanation:
S = 10 plus 20 minus 5 multiply 4 divide 50
= 10+20-5*4/50
= 30-5*4/50
=25*4/50
= 100/50
=2

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
50 multiply 3 plus 21 plus 13 divide 3

Output:
61
