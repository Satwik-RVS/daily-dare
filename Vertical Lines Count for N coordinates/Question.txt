Vertical Lines Count for N coordinates

The program must accept the coordinates (x, y) of N distinct points and an integer L as the
input. The program must print the number of vertical lines of length L that can be formed
using the given N points as the output.

Boundary Cendition(s):
2 <= N <= 500
10 <= x, y <= 10
1 <= L <= 20

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains the coordinates(x, y) of a point.
The N+2nd line contains L.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the number of vertical lines of length L
that can be formed using the given N points.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
9
1 3
-1 1
2 4
1 -3
-1 3
1 0
-1 -2
1 2
2 1
3

Output:
4

Explanation:
Here L = 3.
The four vertical lines of length 3 that can be formed using the 9 points are given below.
Line 1: (-1, 1) to (-1, -2)
Line 2: (1, 3) to (1, 0)
Line 3: (1, 0) to (1, -3)
Line 4: (2, 4) to (2, 1)

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
12
0 0
2 0
4 0
-2 0
-4 0
4 2
4 4
2 2
0 2
2 4
0 4
-4 2
2

Output:
7
