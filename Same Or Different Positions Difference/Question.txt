Same Or Different Positions Difference

The program must accept an array of N distinct integers as the input. The program must print
the absolute difference between X and Y as the output. The integer X represents the sum of
integers whose positions are not changed in the array when sorted in ascending order. The
integer Y represents the sum of integers whose positions are changed in the array when
sorted in ascending order.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <10^15

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the absolute difference between X and Y.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
3
60 10 70 40 50 20 30 80

Output:
20

Explanation:
After sorting the given 8 integers in ascending order, the integers become
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
X = 40 + 50 + 80 = 170
Y = 60 + 10 + 70 + 20 + 30 = 190.
The absolute difference between X and Y is 20, which is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
12543

Output:
1

Max Execution Time Limit: 150 millisecs
