First N Terms Sum

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the sum of the
first N terms in the following series,
1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... and so on.

The above series contains the integers 1, 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 4, 1 to 5, 1 to 6, and so on

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1046

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the sum of the first N terms in the above
mentioned series.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input
7
Output:
11

Explanation:
The first 7 terms are 1 1 2 1 2 3 1.
So their sum is 11 (1+1+2+1+2+3+1).


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
10

Output:
20
Max Execution Time Limit: 150 millisecs
