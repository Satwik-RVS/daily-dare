Submatrices With Common Characters

The program must accept a character matrix of size R*C and an integer K as the input. The
values of R and C are always divisible by K, The program must print the count of common
characters in all the K*K submatrices of the given matrix.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C characters separated by a space.
The (R+2)nd line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the count of common characters in all the K*K
submatrices of the given matrix.
