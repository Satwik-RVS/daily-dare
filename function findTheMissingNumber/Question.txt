function findTheMissingNumber

The function/method findTheMissingNumber accepts three arguments R, C and matrix. The
integers R and C represent the size of the integer matrix. The given matrix contains a series of
R*C consecutive positive integers but exactly one integer is missing. The missing integer is
denoted by -1 in the matrix.

The function/method findTheMissingNumber must find the missing integer and replace -1 with
the missing integer in the matrix.

Note: The first and last values in the series of R*C consecutive positive integers are always
present in the matrix.

Your task is to implement the function findTheMissingNumber so that the program runs
successfully.

IMPORTANT: Use the main() function, Which is defined below.

int main()
{
    int R, C;
    scanf("%d %d", &R, &C);
    int matrix[R][C];
    for(int row = 0; row < R; row++)
    {
        for(int col = 0; col < C; col++)
        {
            scanf("%d", &matrix[row][col]);
        }
    }
    findTheMissingNumber(R, C, matrix);
    for(int row = 0; row < R; row++)
    {
        for(int col = 0; col < C; col++)
        {
            printf("%d ", matrix[row][col]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
3 3
2 9 7
6 3 1
-1 5 8

Output:
2 9 7
6 3 1
4 5 8

Explanation:

Here R = 3 andC = 3.
The matrix contains all the positive integers from 1 to 9, but 4 is missing.
Hence -1 is replaced with 4.
2 9 7
6 3 1
4 5 8

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
5 4
30 23 21 28
29 19 11 25
22 13 15 -1
20 17 18 14
26 24 16 12

Output:
30 23 21 28
29 19 11 25
22 13 15 27
20 17 18 14
26 24 16 12
