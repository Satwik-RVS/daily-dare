Form Integers Which are Divisible by 25

The program must accept a string S representing a number. The string S contains digits,
underscores and X's. The program must print the number of possible integers that can be
formed from the string S based on the following conditions.
- All the underscores must be replaced with the digits.
- All X's must be replaced with a same digit.
- The integer must be divisible by 25 and does not contain any leading zeroes.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 7

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the number of possible integers that can
be formed from the string S.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
8_XX

Output:
10

Explanation:
Here the given string is 8_XX.
The 10 possible integers are given below.
8000
8100
8200
8300
8400
8500
8600
8700
8800
8900

Example Input/Outpu 2:

Input:
25

Output:
9

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
0_75

Output:
0

Explanation:
Here the given string is 0_75.
There is no way to form such integers as the given string starts with 0.

Example Input/Output 4:

Input:
0

Output:
1

Explanation:
Here the given string is 0.
The only integer that can be formed is 0 which is divisible by 25.
