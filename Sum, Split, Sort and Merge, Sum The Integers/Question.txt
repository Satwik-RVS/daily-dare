Sum, Split, Sort and Merge, Sum The Integers

The program must accept N integers as the input, where each integer contains a pipe symbol.
The program must find the sum of the given N integers as. S1. Then the program must split
each integer in two parts based on the pipe symbol. Then the program must sort the resulting
N*2 integers and concatenate every two integers. Then the program must find the sum of N
resulting integers as S2. Finally, the program must print the values of S1 and S2 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1<=N <= 100
10 <= Each integer value <= 1046

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the values of S1 and $2 separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
4
12|3 98|54 23|02 8|76

Output:
13155 10887

Explanation:
Here N = 4.
S1 = 123 + 9854 + 2302 + 876 = 13155.
After dividing each integer two parts, the integers become
12 39854232876
After sorting the 8 integers, the integers become
23812 23 54 7698
After merging every two integers, the integers become
23 812 2354 7698
S2 = 23 + 812 + 2354 + 7698 = 10887.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
3]38 57|00 1|1 5|36 389|9 74|52

Output:
17936 83357

Max Execution Time Limit: 50 millisecs
