Total Distance From Smallest to Largest

The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C containing only unique integers as the
input. The program must find the distance between the smallest integer and the 274 smallest
integer. Then the program must find the distance between the 2"Â¢ smallest integer and the 3"
smallest integer and so on. Finally, the program must print the total distance as the output.
Distance between two integers X and Y in the matrix = Maximum(Absolute difference
between the row positions of X and Y, Absolute difference between the column positions of X
and Y).

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R,C <=50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 10^4

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integer values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer value representing the total distance.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
3 3
6 7 4
3 8 5
2 9 1

Output:
11

Explanation:
Distance between 1 and 2: 2
Distance between 2 and 3: 1
Distance between 3 and 4: 2
Distance between 4 and 5: 1
Distance between 5 and 6: 2
Distance between 6 and 7: 1
Distance between 7 and 8: 1
Distance between 8 and 9: 1
Total distance = 2+1+2+1+2+1+1+1 = 11.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
3 4
50 65 60 94
87 12 70 44
21 81 40 32

Output:
18
