Sum of First D Surrounding Digits

The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C containing only digits from 1 to 8 as
the input. For each digit D in the matrix, the program must print the sum of the first D
surrounding digits as the output. If the number of surrounding digits of D is less than D, then
the program must print the sum of all the surrounding digits of D.
The order of surrounding digits is given below.
top-left, top, top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left and left.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R,C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space representing the sum of
surrounding digits based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
3 3
7 5 2
3 8 3
2 4 1

Output:
16 23 11
20 27 8
11 15 8

Explanation:
The integer at (1,1) is 7->5+8+3=16.
The integer at (1,2) is 5->7+2+3+8+3=23.
The integer at (1, 3) is 2->3+8=11.
The integer at (2, 1) is 3->7+5+8=20.
The integer at (2, 2) is 8->7+5+2+34+1+4+2+3=27.
The integer at (2, 3) is 3->5+2+1=8.
The integer at (3, 1) is 2-> 3+8=11.
The integer at (3, 2) is 4->3+8+3+1=15.
The integer at (3, 3) is 1-> 8 = 8.
Hence the output is
16 23 11
20 27 8
11 15 8

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
3 4
3 4 4 3
1 7 1 4
3 5 5 2

Output:
12 13 15 9
3 25 4 14
13 17 19 5
