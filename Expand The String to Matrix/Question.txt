Expand The String to Matrix

The program must accept a matrix of size R*C containing compressed string values as the
input. A compressed string contains alphabet-integer pairs which represent the alphabets and
their frequencies. For each compressed string in the matrix, the program must expand the
compressed string as a string of length 9 and print the characters in 3*3 matrix format as
shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= R, C <= 15

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C compressed string values separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R*3 lines, each contains C*3 characters separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
2 2
b4c1a4 b1a1c5a2
a3b3c3 c9

Output:
b b b b a c
b c a c c c
a a a c a a
a a a c c c
b b b c c c
c c c c c c

Explanation:
Here R = 2, C = 2 and the four compressed string values are expanded as below.
b4c1a4 -> bbbbcaaa
b b b
b c a
a a a

bla1c5a2 -> bacccccaa
b a c
c c c
c a a

a3b3c3 -> aaabbbccc
a a a
b b b
c c c

c9 -> ccccccccc
c c c
c c c
c c c

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
2 3
a3b3c3 b1cla7 x4y1z4
p9 a8c1 z2y2x5

Output:
a a a b c a x x x
b b b a a a x y z
c c c a a a z z z
p p p a a a z z y
p p p a a a y x x
p p p a a c x x x 

Max Execution Time Limit: 150 millisecs
