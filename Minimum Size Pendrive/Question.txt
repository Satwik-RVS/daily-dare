Minimum Size Pendrive

The program must accept N integers representing the sizes of N videos (in MB) as the input.
A boy wants to store all the N videos in a single pendrive. The pendrives are available in sizes
of 2^K (where K > = 0). The program must print the minimum size of pendrive (in MB)
required to store all the N videos as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Size of each video(in MB) <= 10^6

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space representing the sizes of the N
videos (in MB).

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the minimum size of pendrive (in MB) required
to store all the N videos.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
51 64 80 54 43 27 89

Output:
512

Explanation:
Total size of the 7 videos = 51 + 64 + 80 + 54 + 43 + 27 + 89 = 408.
Since the pendrives are available in powers of 2, the minimum size of the pendrive required is
512.
Hence 512 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
6
2 3 5 9 8 9

Output:
64

Max Execution Time Limit: 100 millisecs
