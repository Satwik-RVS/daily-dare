function AddOrConcate

The function/method concatorAdd accepts two arguments str1 and str2 representing two
string values. The values of both str1 and str2 can be integers or floating point values
words.The function/method concatOrAdd must return a string based on the following conditions.
- If both str1 and str2 are integers, then the function return their sum as a string.
- If both str1 and str2 are floating point values, then the function return their sum with the 36
  precision up to 2 decimal places as a string.
Otherwise, the function must concatenate both the words and return the concatenated
string. Your task is to implement the function concatorAdd so that the program runs successfully.

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
300 450

Output:
750

Explanation:
Both the values are integer values.
So their sum is printed.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
15.52 123.676

Output:
139.20

Explanation:
Both the values are floating point values.
So their sum is printed with the precision up to 2 decimal places.

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
Skill Rack

Output:
SkillRack

Explanation:
Both the values are string values(words).
So they are concatenated and printed as the output.
