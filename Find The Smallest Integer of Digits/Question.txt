Find The Smallest Integer of Digits

The program must accept N integers and an integer K as the input. For each digit D in K, the
program must find the smallest integer that contains the digit D. If there is nointeger with the
digit D, then consider 0 for that digit. Finally, the program must print the sum of resulting
integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value, K <= 10^7

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains an.integer representing the sum of resulting integers based on the given
conditions.

Example input/Output 1:

Input:
7
909 880 283 205 790 495 922
248

Output:
983

Explanation:
Here K = 248.
1 digit is 2: The smallest integer having the digit 2 is 205.
2 digit 4: The smallest integer having the digit 4 is 495.
3 digit is 8: The smallest integer having the digit 8 is 283.
205 + 495 + 283 = 983.
Hence 983 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
5
96 23 43 113 6
31517

Output:
249

Explanation:
Here K = 31517.
1 is 3: The smallest integer having the digit 3 is 23.
2 digit is 1: The smallest integer having the digit 1 is 113.
3 di 5: There is no integer with the digit 5.
4 digit is 1: The smallest integer having the digit 1 is 113.
5 digit is 7: There is no integer with the digit 7.
23 +113 +0+ 113 +0 = 249.
Hence 249 is printed as the output.
