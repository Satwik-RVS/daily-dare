Form Smallest 5-Digit Integer

The program must accept an integer S as the input. The program must print the smallest 5-
digit integer whose sum of digits is equal to S. If it is not possible to form such an integer,
then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Cendition(s):g
1<=S<=50

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the smallest 5-digit integer whose sum of digits is equal to S.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
10

Output:
10009

Explanation:
Here S = 10.
The smallest possible 5-digit integer that can be formed is 10009 (1 + 0 +0 +0 + 9 = 10).

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
46

Output:
1

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
25

Output:
10699
