Split String to Find Palindromes

The program must accept a string S as the input. The string S is not a palindrome but it is
formed by concatenating two palindromes. The program must split the string S into two
palindromes and print the palindromes in separate lines as the output.

Boundary Cendition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains a string value representing the first palindrome.
The second line contains a string value representing the second palindrome.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
madamabba
Output:
madam
abba

Explanation:
Here the given string is madamabba.
The string values madam and abba are palindrome, so madam and abba are printed in
separate lines.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
eyerotator

Output:
eye
rotator

Example Input/Output 3:

Input:
