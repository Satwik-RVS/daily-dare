Define the class Stick

The program must accept the length of a stick and Q queries as the input. The query can be
any one of the following two types.
- If the query type is 1, then the program must combine the stick with the given stick of length
X (where X is a non-negative integer). If the length of the stick to be combined is 0, then the
program must print “Length of the stick cannot be zero”.
- If the query type is 2, then the program must break the stick by dividing the length by 2 only
if the length is even. Else the program must print "Length of the stick cannot be odd".
After performing the operation of each query, the program must print the revised length of
the stick.

Your task is to define the class Stick so that the program runs successfully.

Note : Use the main class, which is defined below.

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int stickLen = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
        Stick stick = new Stick(stickLen) ;
        int Q = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine());
        for (int ctr = 1; ctr <= Q; ctr++)
        {
            String query[] = sc.nextLine().trim().split("\\s+");
            int queryType = Integer.parseInt(query[0]);
            if(queryType == 1)
            {
                stick.combineStick(new Stick(Integer.parseInt(query[1])));
            }
            else if(queryType == 2)
            {
                stick.breakStick();
            }
            System.out.println(stick.getLength());
        }
	}
}


Example Input/Output1:

Input
120
5
115
2
15
2
10

Output:
135
Length of the stick cannot be odd
135
140
70
Length of the stick cannot be zero
70

Explanation:
Initially, the length of the stick is 120.
1 query: X = 15. After combining the sticks, the length of the stick becomes 135 (120 + 15).
2 query: The current length of the stick is 135 which is odd. Hence "Length of the stick
cannot be odd" and 135 are printed.
3 query: X = 5. After combining the sticks, the length of the stick becomes 140 (135 + 5).
4 query: The length of the stick is even. Hence the revised length of the stick is 70.
5 query: X = 0. The length of the stick to be combined is 0. Hence "Length of the stick
cannot be zero” and 70 are printed.

Example Input/Output 2:
